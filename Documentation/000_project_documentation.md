## ArtInstallation$Auction

Project description:

This project is being developed in Java in Eclipse IDE using javaFx,  JFoenix, sqlite, libraries.
Brief description of my project: I created a model of electronic auction, and specifically First-price sealed-bid auction.
First-price sealed-bid auctions are when a single bid is made by all bidding parties and the single highest bidder wins and pays what they bid. The main difference between this and English auctions is that bids are not openly viewable or announced.
My auction intends to sell famous installations of artists and designers
Installations can differ in size, they are suitable for people who just want to beautifully equip their apartment or house, and firms, private companies or others can buy an installation from us to decorate their institutions.
